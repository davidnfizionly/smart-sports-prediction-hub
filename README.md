##  30-Second Overview
-  **Production System**: Real-time sports data ingestion → prediction pipeline.  
-  **Low latency**: Predictions generated within **2 seconds** end-to-end.  
-  **100K+ events/day**: Proven scalable pipeline using ECS + Kinesis.  
-  **70% cost reduction**: Serverless + ECS vs EC2-based infrastructure.  
-  **Intelligent predictions**: GPT‑4 generates winners, MVPs, scorers with context.  
-  **Complete automation**: Collector API → Kinesis → Lambda → DynamoDB/S3 → Predictions API → UI.

##  Project Overview
The **Smart Sports Prediction Hub** transforms raw live sports data into **AI-powered insights**.  
It integrates **real-time streaming, NoSQL storage, serverless analytics, and AI reasoning** into a seamless AWS-native architecture.  

**Business Challenge Solved:**  
Sports fans, analysts, and betting platforms often lack **real-time explainable predictions**. This project demonstrates how a **serverless pipeline** can deliver **instant, contextual insights** with minimal infrastructure management.

** Key Outcomes:**
- Real-time ingestion from external APIs (Football‑Data, NBA API, etc.).  
- DynamoDB + S3 dual storage for live + historical analysis.  
- Lambda + GPT‑4 for contextual predictions.  
- Interactive UI hosted on ECS with auto-deployment.  
- Fully automated via CI/CD (GitHub Actions).  

---

##  System Architecture

 External APIs →  Kinesis Stream →  Lambda (analytics + GPT‑4) →  DynamoDB (live) / S3 (history) →  API Gateway →  ECS UI  

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Event-driven, auto-scaling ECS tasks.  
- Polyglot persistence (NoSQL + Data Lake).  
- GPT‑4 integrated directly into analytics Lambda.  
- IAM least privilege enforced (IRSA for ECS tasks).
